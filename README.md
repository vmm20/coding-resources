# coding-resources
This repository contains files for my Coding Resources website, a collection of various websites and tutorials I have found over the years that help people learn how to code.  They are sorted by programming language.  This is a work in progress, and it is not an exhaustive list.

Visit the site [here](https://vmm20.github.io/coding-resources/).

I have created this website in good faith, hoping that someone will find it helpful.  I have filled it with information that is, to the best of my knowledge, accurate.  However, I take no responsibility for any inaccuracies or errors on this website.  Computer programming is a rapidly changing field, and what is true today may not be true months from now.

This website also contains links to some tools, such as Integrated Development Environments, that may be helpful to anyone who wants to learn to code on a local machine, rather than on a website.  Some of these tools are open source, and others are proprietary.  I do not intend to endorse or favor any of these tools over others.
